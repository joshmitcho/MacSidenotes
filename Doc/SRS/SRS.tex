\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

The purpose of this project is to give those who have trouble with online disorganization 
a vehicle in which they can fully catalogue their internet navigation, leading to a more 
enhanced, stress-free browsing experience. 

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}

The client for this project is Dr. Spencer Smith of McMaster University.

\subsubsection{The Customers}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Anyone who is looking for a more in depth and organized way of tracking where

	\item Those who take a more thorough approach to their online organization, such as 
	students and working professionals.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Team members creating the application. 
	\item Teaching Assistant's interested in the project. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints} %-- Added subsections to organize the madated 
%constraints
\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
Description: The product shall be able to be used by any computer running Windows, 
Mac OS, Linux or Chrome OS with downloaded Google Chrome browser.
Rationale: The user will not be restricted by operating system.
Fit Criterion: The product shall be tested in all operating systems to ensure compatibility. 

\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
The application will be developed based on an existing open source project written in 
JavasScript. 

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Google Chrome (Chrome): Google Chrome is a freeware web browser developed 
	by Google.
	\item JavaScript: An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used 
	to create interactive effects within web browsers.
	\item URL: An acronym for Uniform Resource Locator and is a reference (an 
	address) to a resource on the Internet (ie. a Website). 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

User must have a working computer with chrome installed. The user must have some 
familiarity with surfing the web and general internet/computer use. The user must have an 
understanding of the English language if they wish to comprehend any additional 
instructions given. 

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

Currently in the Chrome Web Store, there exists a few extensions that function 
similarly to MacSidenotes. However, each either lacks a feature of this 
product, or suffers from bugs and is poorly reviewed.\\
\\
MacSidenotes' combination of simplicity, dependable functionality and ability 
to link back to web pages from the Note List set it apart from the current 
offerings.

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}

	\end{tabularx}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}
{\bf 1.} User wishes to create a note for a Wikipedia article (or any webpage) 
they are viewing, so they click the MacSidenotes icon in their chrome browser. 
The notes sidebar appears on the right side of the screen\\
{\bf 2.} User begins to type their note, "Section 7 is relevant for thesis 
paper" and it appears in the sidebar.\\
{\bf 3.} User clicks the save icon, and their note is saved in local browser 
storage along with the URL to that article.\\
{\bf 4.} User wishes to view all previous notes, so they click the MacSidenotes 
icon followed by the Notes List icon. A list of notes the user has recorded in 
the past appear, alongside their respective source URLs.\\
{\bf 5.} User wishes to recall a specific previous note, so they click on that 
note in the Notes List. Chrome then takes them to the URL associated with that 
note, displaying the note in the sidebar as it appeared when they saved it.

	*Note: this is the existing extension that this project is based on. It is currently in a non-functioning state, although some insight into extension design can be gleaned from it.
\subsection{New Problems}
\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
	Due to the siloed implementation of Chrome extensions, MacSidenotes should have no adverse effects on the functionality of other extensions.
\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
	MacSidenotes will appear in the extension bar alongside any other extensions the user has installed. Other than making the address bar shorter (by the length of the MacSidenotes icon), it should co-exist peacefully with the rest of the user's Chrome ecosystem.
\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}
	MacSidenotes should not adversely affect the user's interaction with other Chrome extensions.
\subsubsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product} 	
	If the user's machine barely meets Chrome's minimum system specifications, adding MacSidenotes (or any other extension for that matter) may cause slowdown or crashes. This is unlikely, however, given the lightweight nature of MacSidenotes and the system specifications of most semi-modern computers.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
	Due to the siloed nature of Chrome extensions, modifications to the existing system are not necessary for the implementation of MacSidenotes.
\subsection{Risks}
\begin{table}[H]
	\setlength{\extrarowheight}{1ex}
	\caption {\bf Risks}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{N|C|L|C}
		{\bf Priority} & {\bf Risk} & {\bf Probability, \newline Severity} & {\bf Mitigation Plan}\\
		\hline
		1 & Developers' inexperience with JavaScript prevents correct/timely implementation of project & 5\%,  Extreme & Familiarizing with some of the many relevant JavaScript tutorials found online\\
		2 & Developers' inability to meet deadlines prevents timely completion of project & 5\%, Extreme & Adhering to a weekly meeting schedule and discussing possible setbacks before they become overwhelming\\
		3 & Incorrect implementation of Req F.3 causes loss of user data & 10\%,  High & Thorough and complete testing of the note saving system\\
	\end{tabularx}
	
\end{table}

\subsection{Costs}
	Costs will be measured in time required to complete each Functional Requirement.
\begin{table}[H]
	\setlength{\extrarowheight}{1ex}
	\caption {\bf Costs}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{R|R}
		{\bf Requirement} & {\bf Time} \\
		\hline
		F.1 & 3 Days \\
		F.2 & 1 Day \\
		F.3 & 3 Days \\
		F.4 & 2 Days \\
		F.5 & 2 Days \\
		
	\end{tabularx}
	
\end{table}

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}
	\begin{table}[H]
		\setlength{\extrarowheight}{1ex}
		\caption {\bf User Documentation Requirements}
		\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{R|R}
			{\bf Documentation} & {\bf Purpose} \\
			\hline
			Chrome Web Store Overview & To describe the extension's features to potential users \\
			How To Use Button & To introduce new users to the functionality of MacSidenotes. It lists the steps required to create, save and recall notes.\\
		\end{tabularx}
		
	\end{table}
\subsubsection{Training Requirements}
	MacSidenotes requires no training to be used.
	
\subsection{Waiting Room}
	In future, notes may be able to be stored in a cloud service like Google Drive or Dropbox to be accessed from anywhere. They may also be linked to the user's Chrome account to sync across multiple devices.\\
	These requirements are not necessary for a minimum viable product, so they will be revisited once a minimum viable product is achieved.
\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
	None at this time.

additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.
